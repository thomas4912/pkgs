## abremObj.r
## This is a temporary function to permit creation of an abrem class object within pivotals for testing purposes.
## The abrem object is formed from a vector of complete failures, or alternatively individual vectors for failures
## and suspensions.  MRR functions in pivotals will only accept an object of class abrem.  This function is expected
## to be depreciated in favor of function abrem::Abrem.
