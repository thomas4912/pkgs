\title{Y on X median rank regression for lognormal 2-parameter } 

\description{
\code{MRRw2pyx} fits a set of data consisting of failures, or alternatively failures and suspensions,
 to the 2-parameter lognormal distribution.
}

\usage{
 MRRln2pyx(x, options=NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{An object of class abrem}
  \item{options}{An optional list object such as generated by options.abrem including the named item method.fit.
  Implementation only accounts for the second element of method.fit with a value of "qbeta", otherwise the method
  of fitting will default to Benard's approximation for determining plotting positions.}
}

\value{
   A vector containing results in the following order: Mulog, Sigmalog, R_squared
}

\details{
  This function assures that data has been entered as an abrem object.
  A call is made to a fast C++ implementation to complete the regression. Y on X regression is considered
  an alternative for possible use with interval censored data by Dr. Abernethy. Refer to section 5.8 of The New
  Weibull Handbook, Fifth Edition.
