## MLEw2_cpp.r
## This is  a wrapper function calling a C++ implementation of the MLE optimization obtained by identifying the root of the
## derivative with respect to Beta of the Weibull 2-parameter likelihood function as presented in The Weibull Handbook,
## Fifth Edition, by Robert B. Abernethy.
